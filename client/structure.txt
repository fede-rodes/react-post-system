App.controllers.Main
   App.pages.Home (smart component)
      App.views.mobile.Home (container component; it includes App.components.Header and App.components.Footer)
      {App.components.<key>} (dumb presentational components that take in props and spit out HTML)



1. 'Pages' are top-level components that are called by the router. They may or may
not handle data.
2. 'Views' are wrappers around components. They may or may not handle data.
3. Containers are 'smart' components that handle data loading (subscribing and
Minimongo calls) but don’t contain any HTML of their own.
4. Components are “dumb” presentational components that take in props and spit
out HTML. They may or may not be functional stateless components.
